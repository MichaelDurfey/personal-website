Covid and shelter in place has given me a lot of time for some of my hobbies like photography. I've also learned a lot of things, like how to put a mask on with one hand or <strong>how to edit photos using lightroom!</strong> I enjoy landscape photography the most.

Here are a few pictures from a recent trip up to Northern California to camp in the Redwoods State Park area. We camped just east of Crescent Beach Overlook at Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park.
